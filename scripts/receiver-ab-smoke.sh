Usage: bash scripts/receiver-ab-smoke.sh baseline|skip-deferred|periodic-10

Runs one foreground rQuickShare session and captures a timestamped log under
~/Downloads/rquickshare-smoke/ab-logs/. Close the app from its tray before starting each trial. After receiving the
file, select Quit from the rQuickShare tray menu, not Ctrl+C: the graceful
shutdown unregisters its mDNS service so Android does not cache stale peers.
Run three independent cold-start trials of each variant with the same device,
network, visibility and app foreground/background state.
