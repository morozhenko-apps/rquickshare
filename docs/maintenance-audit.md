# rQuickShare maintained fork — audit and Mode B hardening

_Last updated: 2026-10-06_

This document is the working log for the `morozhenko-apps/rquickshare` maintenance pass. It is intentionally kept separate from release notes: it tracks audit scope, upstream triage, CI gates, fixes, and the final Mode B verification before fast-forwarding `dev` into `master`.

## Current CI policy

- `dev`: fast preflight only — Rust formatting, Rust tests, Clippy, frontend lint/typecheck/unit tests.
- Internal `dev -> master` PR: duplicate heavy jobs are skipped; the push to `dev` is the authoritative preflight.
- Package/build smoke: manual only. No Tauri packaging on every development commit.
- Release artifact build: manual only.
- Mode B: stable tests run once; only explicitly flaky/stability-sensitive tests are repeated 10 times.
- `master`: updated only after the audit is complete and the final gates are green.

## Current gate status

A full `dev` revalidation is in progress after dependency, clipboard, logging and Tauri security hardening.

The last representative dependency-upgrade preflight had four green jobs (Rust format, core tests, core Clippy and frontend lint/typecheck/unit) and one Tauri Clippy failure caused only by five newly surfaced lint/deprecation findings. Those findings have been fixed; a fresh authoritative `push dev` preflight is now running.

The internal `dev -> master` PR validation is intentionally skipped to avoid duplicating the authoritative `push dev` preflight.

## Completed work

### CI and toolchain

- Removed automatic package builds from normal `dev` pushes.
- Moved package smoke to a manual workflow.
- Moved release packaging to a manual workflow.
- Updated GitHub Actions away from Node 20-backed actions and configured Node 24 for frontend CI.
- Removed the deprecated `arduino/setup-protoc` action; Linux CI installs `protobuf-compiler` directly.
- Removed deprecated/redundant cache/action usage found during validation.
- Aligned Rust formatting/Clippy toolchains with the repository's actual toolchain requirements.
- Removed duplicate Rust formatting work and duplicate internal PR validation.
- Enabled cancellation of superseded runs.

### Repository metadata / maintenance

- Aligned crate/package license metadata with the repository GPLv3 license.
- Disabled automatic release-please activity for the maintained fork; release preparation is manual.
- Replaced the stale Tauri 2.2 dependency set with current Tauri v2 packages (Tauri core/API/CLI 2.12.1 plus current compatible plugin minors).
- Regenerated Cargo.lock and pnpm-lock.yaml reproducibly on GitHub-hosted runners and removed the temporary sync workflows afterwards.
- Updated the frontend toolchain conservatively inside its existing major lines: ESLint 9, Tailwind 3, TypeScript 5, Vite 6 and Vitest 3.
- Removed the unused Vue DevTools/Electron development stack that was responsible for a large obsolete vulnerability tree.
- Added weekly/manual dependency security auditing for both Rust lockfiles and frontend dependencies.
- Current Rust cargo-audit is clean for both lockfiles.
- Current JavaScript production/runtime audit has no known vulnerabilities.
- Full JavaScript dev-tooling audit has one accepted high-severity build-only advisory: Tailwind CSS 3.4.19 pulls `braces 3.0.3` through its watcher/glob chain; the advisory currently has no patched `braces` release. This dependency is not shipped in the Tauri runtime and build inputs are trusted repository files. The runtime audit remains release-blocking; the full toolchain audit remains visible/reporting.

### Protocol / interoperability

- Added currently used Nearby frame types 8–12 to the protobuf enum.
- Added/retained compatibility for compact mDNS endpoint information and fallback device naming.
- Reviewed upstream interoperability PRs before integrating equivalent fixes instead of blindly merging stale branches.

### Linux BLE lifecycle

- Added background BLE scan duty-cycling to avoid keeping BlueZ in continuous discovery while the app sits in the tray.
- Made BLE advertising follow receive visibility rather than outbound discovery mode.
- Added foreground/background lifecycle signalling.
- Unified scan/advertising lifecycle so send discovery and receive visibility do not fight each other.

This work is intended to cover the same problem areas reported upstream in issues/PRs such as #429, #430 and #404.

### Inbound hardening

- Reject unsafe received filenames instead of joining remote path components directly into the download directory.
- Reject absolute paths, traversal components, separators/control characters and overlong received names.
- Reserve unique destinations for multiple inbound files with the same filename.
- Reject negative or oversized byte payload sizes before allocation.
- Reject byte chunks that exceed the peer-declared size.
- Reject file payload data before the user has accepted the transfer instead of reaching an `unwrap()`.
- Guard offset arithmetic against overflow.
- Reject duplicate payload IDs.
- Reject negative file sizes and total-size overflow.
- Use exclusive destination creation and fail clearly if the configured download directory is unavailable.
- Reject invalid peer P-256 public keys instead of panicking.

### Outbound hardening

- Reject negative or oversized peer-controlled byte payload sizes before allocation.
- Reject byte chunks that exceed declared payload size.
- Replace peer-controlled connection/consent `unwrap()` paths with checked errors.
- Reject invalid peer P-256 public keys instead of panicking.
- Avoid outbound payload-ID collisions.
- Reject non-UTF-8 filenames cleanly instead of panicking.
- Guard total outbound transfer size against overflow.

### Error handling / UI

- Surface transfer errors instead of reducing every failure to a generic unexpected disconnect.
- Stop receiver loops cleanly when their channel closes.
- Normalized transfer state text and Vue markup so lint is meaningful rather than permanently noisy.
- Added a browser Clipboard API fallback when the Tauri clipboard plugin fails on Linux/Wayland, with unit coverage for primary/fallback/failure paths.
- Capped the active on-disk log at 5 MiB per session while keeping stdout logging alive; oversized previous logs are still rotated at startup. Unit tests cover the capped writer.
- Enabled a restrictive production/development Content Security Policy and `freezePrototype` in the Tauri WebView. Production network access is limited to Tauri IPC plus the GitHub API used for release checks.

## Upstream PR / issue triage

Reviewed or identified as relevant:

- PR #442 — missing download-directory handling. Not applied verbatim: silently recreating a configured removable/missing destination is not always desirable; the maintained fork currently fails clearly when the selected destination is unavailable.
- PR #439 / issue #431 — compact mDNS endpoint info and newer frame types. Equivalent compatibility work is included.
- PR #430 / issue #429 — continuous BlueZ discovery interference. Equivalent duty-cycle work is included.
- PR #404 — BLE advertisement based on visibility. Equivalent lifecycle work is included.
- PR #418 — filesystem / transfer error propagation. Equivalent error-surfacing work is included where applicable.
- PR #408 — Tauri JS/Rust dependency alignment. Superseded: the fork now uses current Tauri v2 (2.12.1 core/API/CLI with compatible current plugins) and reproducibly regenerated lockfiles.
- PR #380 / issues #423 and #195 — clipboard fallback. Equivalent behavior is included with dedicated unit tests.
- PR #334 — cancellation during active file sends. Equivalent cancellation handling is included.
- PR #333 — Wi-Fi credential payload parsing. Equivalent handling is included with declared-length validation.
- Issue #268 — unbounded active log growth. Fixed with a 5 MiB runtime file cap.
- PR #420 — large transport/protobuf refactor. Deferred until the maintained fork is green because it is too broad to merge as a bugfix.

Upstream backlog classification for this maintenance pass:

- **Covered by equivalent fixes in this fork:** PRs #439/#433, #430, #418, #408, #404, #380, #334 and #333; issues #431, #429/#369, #423/#195, #421/#407, #268 and #440.
- **Covered by the isolated Pixel receiver work in PR #2:** issue #425 and the modern BLE/GATT receiver bootstrap path; older discovery reports #358/#311/#270 are smoke-test targets because they overlap with the same mDNS/BLE/TCP chain but do not provide enough evidence for separate code changes.
- **Linux packaged-smoke targets rather than speculative code fixes:** #422 (Wayland close/hide behavior), #357/#390/#328 (blank/partial WebKit rendering across mixed GPU/font/EGL causes), #307 (window reopen/GTK lifecycle), #426/#365 (package dependency variance), #325/#394 (generic transfer failures without a single reproducible root cause).
- **Feature requests, not Mode B blockers:** #435/#436 folder hierarchy, #432 multi-file UX, #434 AirDrop interoperability, #428/#363/#246 outbound clipboard/text, #388/#347/#310 custom device name, #387/#384/#224 trusted devices, #386/#383 sorting, #385/#382 tray indicators, #356/#395 localization, #370 visibility tray menu, #411 decorations, #405 update-check toggle, #375 sender image, #368 QR, #366 silent flag, #364 double-click tray, #354/#374 icon variants, #329 Flatpak, #326 Homebrew, #295/#412/#413/#414/#415/#416 Windows work, #264 dock behavior, #245/#182 notification actions.
- **Dependency/packaging PRs superseded or handled independently:** #424, #419, #417, #410, #402, #400, #399, #391, #371, #342, #276 and #241.
- **Deferred architecture work:** PR #420 transport/protobuf refactor. It is intentionally not merged into this hardening pass because PR #2 introduces the minimum transport abstraction required for modern Pixel receive without replacing the hardened state machine.

No remaining upstream item is treated as an automatic blocker solely because it is open; only reproducible defects that overlap the maintained Linux/Android scope can block Mode B.

## Modern Pixel receiver BLE/GATT bootstrap

Upstream issue #425 contains current 2026 evidence that modern Pixel Quick Share can leave Wi-Fi during receiver discovery. In that state, mDNS-only Linux receivers may never appear or may fail before opening the TCP connection.

The implementation is now isolated in draft PR #2 (`feat/pixel-ble-receiver -> dev`) and ports the proven architecture from `martinalderson/rquickshare:feat/ble-receiver-connect-back` without overwriting the fork's hardened inbound code:

- receiver advertisement on service UUID `0xFEF3` using the same endpoint id and hostname as mDNS;
- visibility-aware connectable advertising with retry on transient BlueZ failures;
- Nearby GATT slot plus weave write/notify characteristics;
- bounded weave framing/reassembly and handshake validation;
- the existing hardened UKEY2 / Sharing receive state machine generalized over `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`;
- a migratable BLE/TCP transport that preserves crypto keys and sequence counters;
- encrypted `UPGRADE_PATH_AVAILABLE` negotiation after UKEY2 establishment;
- validated plaintext `CLIENT_INTRODUCTION` / ACK on the new TCP socket;
- LAST_WRITE / SAFE_TO_CLOSE prior-channel handoff;
- LAN address selection that ignores Docker/VPN/tunnel interfaces;
- Wi-Fi-LAN transport swap for the actual payload;
- regression coverage for advertisement layout, weave handshake, framed lengths, LAN-interface filtering and BWU client-introduction validation.

The stable `dev` branch remains green while this larger interoperability change is validated separately. PR #2 must pass its own preflight and a real Pixel -> Linux smoke test before it is merged into `dev`.


## Coverage audit

Coverage is measured explicitly instead of inferring quality from test count.

Current automated suite on the Pixel receiver branch:

- **Rust:** 50 tests pass with `cargo test --all-features`.
- **Frontend:** 25 Vitest tests pass across 6 test files.
- **Total:** 75 automated tests before the separate package/live smoke checks.

Final measured coverage after the Mode B regression expansion:

- **Rust core:** 30.37% line coverage, 29.75% function coverage, 31.19% region coverage.
- `hdl/inbound.rs`: 31.67% lines, up from 14.58% before the introduction/state tests.
- `hdl/outbound.rs`: 30.67% lines, up from 2.38% before file-preparation and consent/wire tests.
- `utils.rs`: 61.34% lines.
- `hdl/bwu.rs`: 95.83% lines.
- `hdl/migratable.rs`: 81.40% lines.
- **Frontend:** 46.18% line/statement coverage, 82.71% branch coverage and 53.33% function coverage.
- `SettingsModal.vue`: 98.05% lines, 90.62% branches, 100% functions.
- `ContentStatus.vue`: 92.75% lines.
- `Heading.vue`: 100% lines/functions/branches.
- `SideMenu.vue`: 98.21% lines.

The remaining low global percentages are concentrated in OS/service orchestration rather than pure protocol logic: BlueZ/GATT service lifecycle, mDNS daemons/discovery, Tauri startup/window/tray wiring and the monolithic `HomePage.vue` event bootstrap. These paths require package/live smoke or explicit dependency seams before unit coverage becomes representative.

No arbitrary repository-wide percentage gate is being introduced in this pass. The useful gate is regression coverage for validated defects plus live Linux/Android smoke for OS-bound behavior. Coverage should rise further as the post-smoke refactors create testable seams.

## Remaining audit work

- Finish residual network/state-machine `unwrap()`/panic review; peer-controlled crypto/size/path panic paths have already been removed.
- Validate the new CSP/freezePrototype behavior in the packaged Linux smoke test.
- Keep the regression coverage map aligned with fixes; current coverage includes mDNS compact records, P-256 normalization, inbound path/size guards, Wi-Fi credential parsing, clipboard fallback, log caps, BLE receiver advertisement, weave framing/handshake, BWU introduction validation and LAN-interface filtering.
- Identify only genuinely flaky/stability-sensitive tests for 10x Mode B repetition.
- Run one manual Linux package build.
- Complete PR #2 validation and real Pixel -> Linux BLE/GATT -> Wi-Fi-LAN smoke.
- Perform install/start/send/receive smoke checks on Linux/Android.
- Run the final Mode B gate.
- Fast-forward `dev` to `master` only after the above is complete.

## Mode B exit criteria

The maintenance pass is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. Normal `dev` preflight is green.
2. New regression tests for fixed defects are green.
3. Stable tests pass once.
4. Designated flaky/stability-sensitive tests pass 10 consecutive runs.
5. Manual package build succeeds.
6. Linux application smoke test succeeds.
7. Android -> Linux receive path succeeds.
8. Linux -> Android send path succeeds.
9. No unresolved high-severity security/reliability finding remains in the audit.
10. `dev` can be fast-forwarded to `master` without merge noise.

## Refactoring audit

Refactoring is required, but the work is split by risk.

### Do after real-device smoke, before long-term maintenance work

1. **Extract a shared secure-session layer from inbound/outbound.**
   - `core_lib/src/hdl/inbound.rs` is about 2,059 lines.
   - `core_lib/src/hdl/outbound.rs` is about 1,403 lines.
   - Both implement parallel UKEY2 / D2D crypto responsibilities: key exchange finalization, encrypted frame send/decrypt, HMAC handling, sequence counters, keepalive and frame I/O.
   - This duplication makes protocol/security fixes easy to apply on one direction and miss on the other.
   - Recommended target: a shared `SecureSession`/crypto transport helper that owns derived keys, sequence counters, secure-message encode/decode and common frame I/O.
   - **Do not perform this extraction before Pixel smoke** because it touches the most sensitive protocol path.

2. **Split inbound state-machine responsibilities.**
   - `process_offline_frame` is roughly 250 lines.
   - `process_introduction` is roughly 200 lines.
   - `do_bandwidth_upgrade` is roughly 130 lines.
   - The current module combines connection negotiation, UKEY2, secure framing, consent, payload validation, filesystem output and bandwidth upgrade.
   - Recommended split after smoke: `secure_session.rs`, `inbound_transfer.rs`, `bwu.rs`/routing helpers, keeping one explicit state-machine coordinator.

3. **Split outbound transfer construction from secure transport.**
   - `process_consent` is roughly 230 lines and mixes consent state, file metadata, file I/O and payload transmission.
   - Text sending remains TODO in two outbound locations.
   - Recommended split: transfer plan/payload source abstraction separate from crypto/channel transport.

### Medium-priority cleanup

4. **Break up GATT session orchestration.**
   - `gatt.rs` is roughly 492 lines; `weave_session` alone is about 227 lines.
   - Separate framing/reassembly, connection handshake and duplex bridge lifecycle once the Pixel path is proven on hardware.
   - Keep the current bounded queue, disconnect handling and BLE->TCP migration invariants covered during any extraction.

5. **Separate utility domains.**
   - `utils.rs` currently mixes mDNS encoding, P-256 normalization, HKDF, random generation, download-directory lookup and LAN interface selection.
   - Recommended modules: `mdns_codec`, `crypto_utils`, `network_utils`, `filesystem_utils`.
   - This is maintainability work, not a release blocker.

6. **Split desktop orchestration from UI rendering.**
   - `HomePage.vue` is roughly 382 lines and currently combines rendering with settings bootstrap, notification permission, transfer/endpoint/visibility listeners and drag/drop registration.
   - Recommended extraction after smoke: `useTransferEvents`, `useWindowDrop` and `useAppSettings` composables plus smaller transfer/device components.
   - `app/main/src-tauri/src/main.rs` is roughly 387 lines; tray/window lifecycle and receiver-task wiring can become separate modules later.
   - These are UX/maintainability improvements, not protocol blockers.

### Low-risk refactoring already completed

- Shared frame/payload size limits and validation were moved out of inbound/outbound into `core_lib/src/protocol.rs`.
- Duplicate payload-size regression tests were collapsed into one shared test.
- Inbound file-introduction validation was made transactional: the complete file set is validated/prepared before transfer state is mutated, avoiding partial state after malformed metadata.
- Outbound file metadata/file-handle preparation was extracted from the protocol state machine into a dedicated preparation helper with temp-file regression coverage.
- Both preparation helpers now return named result structs instead of opaque multi-value tuples.
- A poisoned `CUSTOM_DOWNLOAD` lock now recovers the configured path instead of silently dropping back to the default directory.
- BWU routing already has its own `BwuRouter` module instead of remaining embedded in the inbound state machine.
- BLE/TCP transport switching already has a small `MigratableStream` abstraction.

### Refactoring rule for this maintenance pass

No broad architectural refactor should be merged solely to improve style before real Pixel smoke. Before the smoke test, only pure helpers, duplicated validation, tests and isolated infrastructure may be extracted. Protocol state-machine refactoring starts only after the current behavior is proven end-to-end.

**Audit conclusion:** no additional architectural refactor is required before the real-device smoke. The next mandatory refactor for maintainability is the shared secure-session extraction, but it should begin only after the current Pixel send/receive behavior is proven so protocol regressions can be distinguished from structural changes.
