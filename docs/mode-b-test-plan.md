# Mode B test plan and coverage map

_Last updated: 2026-10-06_

## Status

**Mode B is not complete.**

Branch consolidation note: PR #2 and PR #3 are now integrated into `dev`. Stages 3-8 were completed for the Pixel/BLE maintenance scope, but the newly integrated Full Quick Share artifacts expand the active `dev` scope and require an inventory/matrix refresh before final execution.

The repository has measured line/function/branch coverage, regression tests, a targeted mutation audit, and a pre-smoke stability run. Those artifacts are useful evidence, but they do not yet satisfy the full Mode B SSOT because the mandatory test inventory, branch map, Positive/N1-N12 matrix, interaction matrix, per-production-file coverage map, and literal completion gate are not fully recorded.

No new tests may be added until Stages 3-8 below are complete.

## Scope

Primary scope is the current `dev` branch. The original inventory covers the Pixel/BLE receiver and maintenance-pass regressions; after branch consolidation, the Full Quick Share protocol/text/clipboard changes integrated into `dev` must also be included before the final Mode B completion gate.

The scope includes all changed production artifacts in:

- `core_lib/src/hdl/blea.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/bwu.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/gatt.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/inbound.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/migratable.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/mod.rs`
- `core_lib/src/hdl/outbound.rs`
- `core_lib/src/lib.rs`
- `core_lib/src/manager.rs`
- `core_lib/src/protocol.rs`
- `core_lib/src/utils.rs`
- `app/main/src/vue_lib/network.ts`

Existing frontend component tests are also in scope where they validate maintenance-pass behavior in `ContentStatus.vue`, `Heading.vue`, `SettingsModal.vue`, and `SideMenu.vue`.

Generated bindings, DTO-only generated protobuf code, package lockfiles, and purely declarative metadata are excluded from branch inventory unless they contain executable product behavior.

## Risk priorities

P0:
- UKEY2 / D2D secure-session state and sequence continuity.
- BLE/GATT bootstrap and BLE -> Wi-Fi-LAN bandwidth upgrade.
- Peer-controlled frame and payload lengths.
- Filesystem path traversal, destination collision, and partial-state handling.
- Peer public-key validation and panic-free malformed input handling.

P1:
- BWU socket routing, cancellation, duplicate registration, and pending-route lifecycle.
- GATT framing/reassembly, queue bounds, malformed connection requests, and disconnect handling.
- LAN interface selection when VPN/Docker/tunnel interfaces coexist.
- Outbound cancellation/consent/file preparation.
- Receive visibility versus outbound discovery lifecycle.

P2:
- Frontend port validation/settings persistence.
- Clipboard fallback and UI state/event regressions.
- Desktop/window/tray behavior that is only representative in packaged smoke.

## Invariants

1. Modern Android discovery may bootstrap over FEF3 BLE/GATT without requiring Wi-Fi discovery first.
2. The full Nearby receiver advertisement is served over GATT while the on-air advertisement remains legacy-sized.
3. Receiver endpoint-info length never exceeds the one-byte protocol limit and UTF-8 truncation remains valid.
4. GATT write buffering is bounded and malformed/oversized framing is rejected.
5. A BWU route can be registered once, cancelled, or consumed exactly once without leaking a pending route.
6. The TCP BWU socket must be routed without consuming bytes required by the inbound state machine.
7. CLIENT_INTRODUCTION must match the expected endpoint and BWU introduction semantics.
8. BLE -> TCP migration preserves the established secure session, keys, and sequence counters.
9. LAST_WRITE / SAFE_TO_CLOSE ordering is preserved during prior-channel handoff.
10. Peer-controlled frame/payload lengths must not cause negative allocation, oversized allocation, overflow, or truncated reads.
11. Inbound filenames must remain one safe path component and duplicate names must reserve unique destinations.
12. A malformed inbound introduction must not partially mutate transfer state.
13. Outbound file preparation must classify supported files deterministically and skip invalid/missing sources without corrupting the transfer plan.
14. Invalid P-256 peer coordinates must return errors rather than panic.
15. LAN selection must reject known virtual/tunnel interfaces and loopback/link-local addresses.
16. No production `unwrap`/`expect`/panic path may be reachable from peer-controlled input in the changed Rust modules.
17. Packaged Ubuntu/KDE behavior remains a required smoke gate for BlueZ coexistence, Wayland UI lifecycle, CSP/freezePrototype, and real Pixel interoperability.

## Current evidence

Baseline before the current SSOT remediation:
- Rust stable suite: 50 tests.
- Frontend stable suite: 25 tests across 6 files.
- Rust core coverage: 30.37% lines, 29.75% functions, 31.19% regions.
- Frontend coverage: 46.18% lines/statements, 82.71% branches, 53.33% functions.

These percentages are now stale because the branch contains additional tests and production fixes. They must not be reported as final Mode B coverage. The current branch adds 28 Rust test functions plus 3 additional frontend table cases relative to that baseline; execution and final counts are pending the new Mode B gate.
- High-value file coverage currently recorded:
  - `hdl/bwu.rs`: 95.83% lines.
  - `hdl/migratable.rs`: 81.40% lines.
  - `hdl/inbound.rs`: 31.67% lines.
  - `hdl/outbound.rs`: 30.67% lines.
  - `utils.rs`: 61.34% lines.
- Targeted mutation audit: 41 mutants, 22 caught, 18 unviable, 1 equivalent/unobservable survivor, 0 timeouts after regression hardening.
- Pre-smoke Mode B run: complete stable suite once plus three selected async transport/BWU tests ten times.

## SSOT compliance gap

The current evidence does **not** yet prove complete Mode B compliance.

Missing mandatory artifacts:
- Stage 3: exhaustive test inventory with risk, level, rationale, expected count, and Positive/N1-N12 applicability.
- Stage 4: executable branch map for every scoped public/business-rule method.
- Stage 5: complete Positive/N1-N12 matrix with no empty cells.
- Stage 6: meaningful interaction combinations.
- Stage 7: expected test-count estimate per artifact/category.
- Stage 8: per-production-file function/branch coverage map with remaining reasons.
- Stage 11: literal SSOT requires ten consecutive successful complete-suite runs; the current workflow repeats only selected stability-sensitive tests.
- Stage 12: explicit YES/NO completion gate for public methods, branches, business rules, invariants, boundaries, N1-N12, and interactions.
- Deliverable D2: test counts broken down by Positive and each N-category.
- Deliverable D4: explicit testability refactors with risk and compatibility assessment.

## Execution plan

### Milestone 1 - Inventory and branch map
Status: COMPLETE

- Enumerate every executable artifact in the scoped production files.
- Map current tests to artifacts.
- Enumerate branches and state transitions for protocol/security/filesystem behavior.
- Mark OS-bound branches that require package/live smoke instead of pretending unit coverage is representative.

Rollback: documentation-only commit.

### Milestone 2 - Test matrix and interaction matrix
Status: COMPLETE

- Build Positive/N1-N12 matrix with explicit N/A reasons.
- Enumerate interaction pairs/triples that can change outcomes, especially transport x visibility x route state, filename x collision x filesystem state, frame length x transport state, and cancellation x consent x transfer state.
- Estimate required test count before implementation.

Rollback: documentation-only commit.

### Milestone 3 - Implement missing deterministic tests
Status: IN PROGRESS

- Add only tests justified by the completed matrix.
- Prefer unit/domain and integration/contract tests.
- Do not add sleeps, real network dependencies, or weak assertions.
- If an important branch is untestable, record the testability defect and apply only a minimal reversible seam.

Rollback: atomic `test:` or `refactor:` commits per logical change.

### Milestone 4 - Mutation and coverage review
Status: NOT STARTED

- Re-run targeted mutation analysis for changed high-risk logic.
- Re-measure Rust/frontend coverage.
- Treat mutation survival in a meaningful branch as missing coverage, not as a percentage problem.

Rollback: tests/refactors remain isolated in atomic commits.

### Milestone 5 - Ten-run automated stability gate
Status: WORKFLOW READY, EXECUTION PENDING

The SSOT supplied on 2026-10-06 is authoritative for this pass. The complete automated suite must pass ten consecutive runs for the final Mode B gate. This is stricter than the earlier repository policy of stable 1x plus selected flaky-sensitive tests 10x.

The Mode B workflow now runs the complete Rust and frontend suite ten consecutive times and, only after those runs succeed, measures fresh Rust and frontend coverage on the same HEAD.

The final hardware/package smoke remains separate and cannot be replaced by CI repetition.

### Milestone 6 - Hardware/package smoke and completion gate
Status: BLOCKED ON TARGET HARDWARE

Required live checks:
- install/start on target Ubuntu/KDE/Wayland;
- window/tray lifecycle;
- CSP/freezePrototype;
- Pixel -> Linux discovery and transfer through BLE/GATT -> Wi-Fi-LAN;
- repeat receive without restarting;
- Linux -> Android send;
- FE2C/FEF3 BlueZ coexistence.

After smoke, re-run the final automated Mode B gate and record Stage 12 answers.

## Implementation progress after inventory

Completed deterministic work:
- fixed receiver advertisement UTF-8 truncation so the one-byte endpoint-info bound cannot cut a multibyte code point;
- covered BWU router empty IDs, unknown routes, dropped receivers, duplicate registration races, and idempotent cancellation;
- covered Weave connection-request boundaries, wrong commands, inverted version ranges, connection-confirm encoding, and framed-message boundaries;
- covered both BLE and TCP variants of the migratable transport;
- strengthened payload-size inner boundaries and non-finite frontend listening-port inputs;
- extracted a pure LAN-address selector and covered tunnel, IPv6, loopback, link-local, public fallback, private preference, interface order, and case-insensitive tunnel names;
- covered BWU listener classification for no-pending, malformed and unregistered introduction paths;
- strengthened inbound filename byte boundaries, malformed Wi-Fi credential UTF-8, oversized plaintext frames, empty plaintext sends, and one-shot BWU request flags;
- covered malformed mDNS Base64/UTF-8;
- fixed mDNS endpoint-name length wrapping and UTF-8 truncation;
- covered outbound audio/video classification.

Two production defects were found by the Mode B review and fixed rather than weakening tests:
1. receiver BLE endpoint names could be truncated in the middle of a UTF-8 code point;
2. mDNS endpoint-name length could wrap through `u8` while retaining the full payload.

Remaining deterministic work is limited to gaps that can be covered without broad pre-smoke protocol refactoring. BlueZ/GATT lifecycle and the full BLE -> Wi-Fi migration remain hardware/package smoke gates.

## Completion gate

Current state:

- all public methods tested? **NO - inventory incomplete**
- all branches tested? **NO - branch map incomplete**
- all business rules tested? **NO - matrix incomplete**
- all invariants tested? **NO - hardware-bound invariants remain**
- all boundary values tested? **NO - full boundary map incomplete**
- all applicable N1-N12 tested? **NO - matrix incomplete**
- all interaction combinations tested? **NO - interaction matrix incomplete**

Therefore Mode B is **NOT COMPLETE**.
